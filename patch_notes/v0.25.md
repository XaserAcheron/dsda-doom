### v0.25.0
- Added basic [build mode](../docs/build_mode.md), including brute force
- Added angle to coordinate display
- Added distance traveled to coordinate display
- Added line interactions to coordinate display
- Added extended hud scale option (under quality of life in general settings)
- Added error message when recording without specifying a compatibility level
- Added `-cl` alias for `-complevel`
- Added automatic time suffix for demo file names
  - Add `$` to the end of your file name to trigger this behaviour
  - You may need to escape this character depending on environment (`-record ny01p\$`)
  - The suffix is only applied for "completed" runs
    - By default a run is assumed to be an IL, so a completed run is one that exits the first map only
    - To apply this logic for movies, use `-movie X` to set the _final map_ that your movie must end on. For example, a doom 1 episode run would use `-movie 8`. A d2all would use `-movie 30`
    - Runs with the same time will have a counter like normal demos (`ny01p006-00002.lmp`)
  - The suffix format depends on the type of run:
    - IL:
      - `9.97` is `997`
      - `10.94` is `010`
      - `1:01.03` is `101`
    - Movie:
      - `0:09` is `009`
      - `1:01` is `101`
      - `2:13:45` is `21345`

#### Console
- Added `assign attribute value`
  - Sets the `value` of `attribute` (a config file key)
  - These changes are temporary and will not be written to the config file
- Added `update attribute value`
  - Sets the `value` of `attribute` (a config file key)
  - These changes are permanent and will be written to the config file
- Added `demo.export X`
  - Exports current demo buffer to file `X.lmp`
  - Existing demo will continue as normal
- Added `demo.start X`
  - Starts a demo recording *in the middle of a session*, with name `X.lmp`
  - Demos may not play back on other operating systems (due to how the state is archived)
  - Consider this experimental right now - the side effects are not well understood
- Added `demo.stop`
  - Exports current demo buffer and stops recording
- Added `jump.to_tic X`
  - Works during playback and recording
- Added `jump.by_tic X`
  - Accepts positive and negative values

- Added `player.give_weapon X`
- Added `player.give_ammo ammo_type [ammo_amount]`
  - If no `ammo_amount` is given, gives the player max ammo

  - Bind `K` to `Script 0`
  - Pressing `K` will now toggle flight, no clip, and god mode

#### Configuration

The way configuration works in dsda-doom has been completely rewritten. This was done to create a generic interface that allows for temporary and permanent changes to every configurable variable. This process required evaluating each variable's presence in the code base and migrating it from the old system to the new one. Since this migration took considerable effort, it was a good excuse to perform an audit on the config file and remove variables that have little value to the port as it currently exists, and to make some semantic changes in a few places. This additionally makes the settings less confusing and overwhelming for new players (though there is still work to do). It also improves predictability in the user experience and reduces the number of bugs that can occur over time. If a setting was removed, it doesn't mean it can't come back - it only means that it did not make the initial cut as I was prioritizing the things that have clear, fundamental importance.
